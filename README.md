# git-clean-simple
A script, written in plain shell, that makes 'git clean' more powerful by extending it by various functionalities like:
  - iterating through each subfolder and executing a git clean, useful if you have a dedicated repository folder
  - logging removed files in an output file
  - recursively iterating through each sub-folder from a specified root and cleaning found repositories
  - executing a dry run to test which files would have been deleted

The script has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
